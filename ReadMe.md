# SearchLite

A backend library for Node.js which uses SQLite (via
[better-sqlite3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/better-sqlite3)) to provide you
an easy to use interface to the FTS5 (Full Text Search) extension.

ToDo: We also have a web server with an API and search UI at
[SearchLite Server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@searchlite/searchlite-server).

ToDo: We also have some scripts which enable you to load documents locally at
[SearchLite Utils](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@searchlite/searchlite-utils).

Each of these projects use this SearchLite package.

## About

1. insert a number of documents into the search index
  - `dataset` so you can index recipes, a website, enron, whatever
  - `location` such as `https://example.com` or `file://path/to/filename.txt`
    or `id-123` ... must be unique per `dataset`
  - `title` such as "Unique Rocky Road"
  - `body` such as the recipe itself
2. uses a table called `doc` for the above document with those fields
3. interal: uses a Sqlite FTS5 virtual table called `ftsi` (for Full Text
   Search Index)
4. when searching, orders the results using BM25 where the weightings are:
  - `title` = 5
  - `body` = 3
  - `location` = 1

That's it really! Any questions?

## Synopsis

Firstly, you'll need `better-sqlite3` since you need to create a DB instance of
it to pass to us. Why? So that we don't take over your database and you can
still use it in whatever way you need. i.e. This search functionality is
additional to your DB.

```js
import Sqlite from 'better-sqlite3'
import SearchLite from '@searchlite/searchlite'

// create your own DB
const db = Sqlite('tmp/synopsis.db')

// as recommended by 'better-sqlite3'
db.pragma('journal_mode = WAL')

// here you can use `db` however you like
// create tables, insert data, query, etc

// create a new SearchLite instance
const sl = new SearchLite(db)

// add three documents (under the 'dataset=recipe')
sl.ens(
  'recipe',
  'https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/easy-rocky-road',
  'Easy rocky road',
  'Great for a bake sale, a gift, or simply an afternoon treat to enjoy with a cup of tea, this rocky road is quick to make and uses mainly storecupboard ingredients.'
)
sl.ens(
  'recipe',
  'https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/collection/chocolate-chip-cookie-recipes',
  'Chocolate chip cookie recipes',
  'Indulge in the ultimate sweet treat on your next tea break: homemade chocolate chip cookies. They pair perfectly with a cup of tea or glass of milk.'
)
sl.ens(
  'recipe',
  'https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/the-big-double-cheeseburger-secret-sauce',
  'The ultimate beef burger',
  'Forget the takeaway and make these double decker homemade cheeseburgers. With gherkins, crisp lettuce and a secret sauce, they take some beating. Have with chips.'
)
sl.ens(
  'recipe',
  'https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/beef-burgers-learn-make',
  'Beef burgers â€“ learn to make',
  'Learn how to make succulent beef burgers with just four ingredients. An easy recipe for perfect homemade patties'
)

// try some searches
console.log('recipe / chocolate:', sl.search('recipe', 'chocolate'))
console.log()

console.log('recipe / tea:', sl.search('recipe', 'tea'))
console.log()

console.log('recipe / beef:', sl.search('recipe', 'beef'))
console.log()
```

## Terms

When adding a document, you might want to add field/value (or multiple) pairs
so you can both store them and match on them when searching.

Remember that when we search, we must match all fields, but you can match any
value in that field. Think of it like "AND" across fields, but "OR" within it.

Example 1 - Recipes

You could consider adding some of the following term field/values:

* `{ cuisine: [ "chinese" ] }`
* `{ cuisine: [ "french" ] }`
* `{ ingredient: [ "chicken", "honey", "soy" ] }`
* `{ diet: [ "vegetarian" ], ingredient: [ "lentil", "egg" ] }`
* `{ cuisine: "french" }`

To query for all French cuisine recipes:

```
  const results = sl.query('recipe', '', { cuisine: [ "french" ] })
```

To find all French recipes that contain at least one type of cheese:

```
  const results = sl.query('recipe', '', { cuisine: [ "french" ], cheese: [ "roquefort", "cancoillotte" ] })
```

To look for all French, German, and Italian recipes:

```
  const results = sl.query('recipe', '', { cuisine: [ "french", "german", "italian" ] })
```

But to look for any French, German and Italian recipe that are vegetarian or
vegan, try this:

```
  const results = sl.query('recipe', '', { cuisine: [ "french", "german", "italian" ], diet: [ "vegetarian", "vegan" ] })
```

Example 2 - Emails

When mining a dataset such as the Enron emails, then we know each email has a
"From:" field. In any of the "To:", "Cc:", and "Bcc:" fields we may have zero,
one, or multiple email addresses.

```
{
  from: [
    "jeff.skilling@enron.com"
  ],
  to: [
   "greg.whalley@enron.com",
   "greg.piper@enron.com"
  ],
  cc: [
    "louise.kitchen@enron.com",
    "mark.koenig@enron.com",
	"kenneth.lay@enron.com",
    "john.lavorato@enron.com",
    "dan.leff@enron.com"
  ]
}
```

Here we are adding 3 fields where we have 1 value for "from", 2 for "to" and 5
for "cc". We have no "bcc" in this email.

To find all emails sent by someone, just try:

```
  const emails = sl.search('enron', '', { from: [ "jeff.skilling@enron.com" ] })
```

To find all emails sent by someone to a particular person:

```
  const emails = sl.search('enron', '', {
    from: [ "jeff.skilling@enron.com" ],
    to: [ "sherri.sera@enron.com" ],
  })
```

Or all emails sent from someone to anyone in a specific group:

```
  const emails = sl.search('enron', '', {
    from: [ "jeff.skilling@enron.com" ],
    to: [
      "sherri.sera@enron.com",
      "jim.fallon@enron.com",
      "louise.kitchen@enron.com",
      "dan.leff@enron.com",
    ]
  })
```

## Roadmap

* ability to add range values such as "quantity=26", "height=176" or
  "created=2023-02-10T01:26:33.554Z", so you can filter for such things as
  "created between 1 Jan 2022 and 31 Dec 2022"

* perhaps one day we allow for providing your own search fields instead of
  using only "location", "title", "body. e.g. "title", "description",
  "content", "profile", "whatever"

## Goals and Non-Goals

Goals:

* a super simple way to fully index any content so you can search it with/from
  JavaScript (Node.js) on the server
* be able to cope with large numbers of documents
* perform a free-text search on content
* be able to filter on terms
* be able to filter on (numeric, datetime) ranges
* allow reasonably complex queries
* use SQLite to be the power behind indexing and queries so we don't have to

Non-Goals:

* be the fastest search engine out there - we just need to be fast enough
* distributed indexing/searching - we just need to be able to index and search
* be the smallest search index - we just need to be small enough
* the most powerful query parser - we just need powerful enough

We proudly sit on top of SQLite and using all of it's power to our
advantage. If you see any design changes that can help with any of the goals or
non-goals we will always consider them assuming no loss of functionality.

## Possible Improvements

### Reverse Index / Posting List for Terms

Instead of storing the terms as `term(doc_id, field, value)`, perhaps we want
to store them as a reverse index such as `term(dataset, field, value,
docIdsAsJsonArray)`. This means we only have one entry for `field, value` per
dataset. This is the same as a "reverse index" or "posting list".

## Releases / Changelog

* v0.2.0 - store and match on terms
  * can now search with an empty query
  * create a new table called 'term'
  * stores the terms provided with each document
  * matches all provided term/values
  * returns the 'matched' property for the number of times each field matches

* v0.1.0 - first release
  * creates the DB schema when instantiated with a `better-sqlite3` DB
  * ins/upd/ens/del documents with "dataset", "location", "title", "body"
  * count all docs in a dataset
  * do a search (with weights) against "location", "title", "body"
